% American Airlines
\subsection{American Airlines -- Fort Worth, TX}
\cventry{02/2015 - Present}{Consultant}{Operations Research \& Advanced Analytics}{}{}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Working to create a machine learning model to better predict flights that will encounter a flight service delay, allowing for improved utilization of ramp  and flight service managers to assist in the boarding process and reduce delays
		\item Analyze the impacts of policy changes to posting and updating delays to departure times through data driven analysis and creation of various metrics to evaluate performance of different hub and gateway airports as well as regional carrier partners
		\item Create Tableau dashboards used by multiple airports and business units to provide information including gate changes, spare crew staffing, airport congestion, and gate check bags
		\item Assist in the development of simulation models and analyses for flight dispatchers and terminal bag room operations to perform a variety of what-if scenarios for planning and policy creation
			\item Developed and maintain the optimization engine for Daily Open Time Coverage/Reserve Assignment System (DOTC/RAS), ensuring the optimal solution maintains contractual obligations while optimizing pilot preferences
		\item Constructed an application used by customer service managers at airports to detect schedule changes based on equipment, flight number, departure time or frequency to assist in pier assignments in the baggage handling systems
		\item Perform many ad hoc analyses and tool development for a variety of airports and business units to help understand and solve problems including gate check bag analysis, predicting aircraft turn times, baggage pier assignments, predicted taxi times, and assignment of crews for recurrent training
		\end{itemize}}
